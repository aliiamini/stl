**stl** is an R package for Survey Transfer Learning (STL)—a sustainable framework for recycling political survey data using deep learning.

It enables researchers to:
- Transfer predictive knowledge from one survey to another (e.g., CES → ANES),
- Generate synthetic responses when key variables are missing,
- Avoid costly, redundant surveys and reduce environmental impact.
